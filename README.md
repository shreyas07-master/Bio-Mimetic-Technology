# Bio-Mimetic-Technology in Robotics and Automation technology

Development and Impact of Bio-mimetic and bio-compatibility in the robotics,mechatronics and automation technology.

The bio mimiced technology is a most embraced with vital solution form the modernized technolgical problem, where the every problem statement securely and secretely determine that, there is a bio-inspired solution which blunt the false tolerance of the modernized problem and cross techniques.

The bio-mimic technological in the robotics and auotmaion enginnering really fascinated every ideates, and where it takes the technology to the developing level with the 


Bio-Mimetic Robotics Project | Inspired by Nature

Excited to share my bio-mimicry–based robotics project, where engineering design is inspired by biological systems to achieve efficient, adaptive, and intelligent motion.

Project Highlights:

1. Nature-inspired mechanical structure and motion strategy

2. Focus on energy efficiency, stability, and adaptability

3. Designed for real-world robotic applications such as automation and exploration

Technologies Used:

1. Embedded Systems: Arduino / ESP32

2. Sensors & Actuators: IMU, Servo Motors
 
3. Control Logic & Algorithms
