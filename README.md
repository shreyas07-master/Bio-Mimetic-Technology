# Bio-Mimetic-Technology in Robotics and Automation technology

Development and Impact of Bio-mimetic and bio-compatibility in the robotics,mechatronics and automation technology.



The bio mimiced technology is a most embraced with vital solution form the modernized technolgical problem, where the every problem statement securely and secretely determine that, there is a bio-inspired solution which blunt the false tolerance of the modernized problem and cross techniques.



The bio-mimic technological in the robotics and auotmaion enginnering really fascinated in the every ideates, and where it takes the technology to the developing level with the technical framed of prototype/project or product so on..!

Bio-Mimetic Robotics desgns, ideas and Project | Inspired by Nature


Excited to share my bio-mimicry–based robotics project, where engineering design is inspired by biological systems to achieve efficient, adaptive, and intelligent motion.




Many of us as seen the bio inspired designs and artitecture in different perspective in our dail life , for example: 


1. Bird inspired bullet metro

2. Falcon inspired jetways

3. Burrs inspired velcro materails

so on...!
which helps in vital ways and also reduce the highly sensitive technology which is non-inspired of any nature agents and which is totally technical framed.




Project Highlights:

1. Nature-inspired mechanical structure and motion strategy

2. Focus on energy efficiency, stability, and adaptability

3. Designed for real-world robotic applications such as automation and exploration

 We divide the biomimetic robots into 3 categories based on the working scenario:
 
 1. biomimetic multi-legged robot (land),


 2. biomimetic flapping-wing robot (sky),


 3. biomimetic underwater robot (sea).
 
  Besides, we also survey the soft robot due to its intrinsic biomimetic properties.

Technologies Used in the robotics and automation:

1. Embedded Systems: Arduino / ESP32 and other microcontrollers/microprocessor 

2. Sensors & Actuators: IMU, Servo Motors, stepper motors, and even BLDC and DC geared motors
 
3. Control Logic & Algorithms (Path planning, motion planning, reinforcement learning)

4. CAD & Prototyping

5. Robotics concepts inspired by biological locomotion

Advantages :

1.	High Energy Efficiency


2.	Flexibility and Adaptation in Ever


3.	Autonomy and Intelligence


4.	Enhanced Sensing & Perception


5.	Flexibility and Soft Interaction


6.Eco-Friendly & Sustainable


7. Applications within Health Care






Aim and motivation:


A. Imitate Nature for Efficient Design


Nature has the imitation of natural processes like animal movement, perception, and decision-making in robots in order to achieve greater efficiency.


B. Enhance Autonomy Behavior


To create robots capable of autonomous environmental perception, learning, and reaction, as in the case of human beings, insects, birds, and aquatic creatures.


c. Enhance Energy Efficiency and Performance

Biological systems are optimized by evolution. Biomimetic systems seek to consume less energy, increase speed, stability, and accuracy. 



Support Operation in Complex Environments For the development of robots that can operate in uneven terrains, confined spaces, water, and disaster zones, where conventional robots cannot.
